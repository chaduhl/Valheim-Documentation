# How to Set Up a Valheim Server on G-Portal

## Connecting to the Server

It's easiest to setup your new G-Portal server as a *favorite server* in Steam and launching it there instead of looking up and typing in the IP address for it all the time.

Here's how you do it:

Open up Steam and navigate to `View > Servers`.

The **Servers** window will open. You can see the server I already added in the image below. Click **Add a Server** at the bottom of the window.

In the popup, enter your server's IP address. Use the IP ***with the Query Port*** located under the server title at the top of the server's status page on G-Portal.

Back on the main **Servers** window, select the newly added server and click **Connect**.

Enter the **Game Password** for the world on your server. You can find this in the **Basic Settings** tab of the left-hand menu. It'll be the password right above your **SavegameName**.

Once you hit connect, Steam will automatically launch Valheim. You will be prompted to select your character before re-entering the game password before connecting.

Voila! You have successfully set up your G-Portal Valheim server for easy access.
