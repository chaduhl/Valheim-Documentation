# How to Set Up a Valheim Server on G-Portal

## Connecting to the Server

There are multiple ways to connect to your G-Portal server.

### Direct Connect in Valheim

When choosing a world to load in Valheim, select the **Join Game** tab then click **Join IP**.

Enter your server's IP address ***with the normal Port code***. It usually ends in a `0`. Click **Connect**.

Enter the password for your game and hit **Enter**.

### Favorite the Server in Steam

This method is a bit more involved, but it's nice since you don't need to remember your server's IP address. After setting up your new G-Portal server as a *favorite server* in Steam, you will be able to launch it there instead of looking up and typing in the IP address for it all the time.

Here's how you do it:

Open up Steam and navigate to `View > Servers`.

The **Servers** window will open. You can see the server I already added in the image below. Click **Add a Server** at the bottom of the window.

In the popup, enter your server's IP address. Use the IP ***with the Query Port*** located under the server title at the top of the server's status page on G-Portal. The **Query Port** usually ends in a `1`.

Back on the main **Servers** window, select the newly added server and click **Connect**.

![Step 4](https://github.com/chaduhl/Valheim-Documentation/blob/main/img/connecting-to-server/step4.png?raw=true)

Enter the **Game Password** for the world on your server. You can find this in the **Basic Settings** tab of the left-hand menu. It'll be the password right above your **SavegameName**.

![Step 5](https://github.com/chaduhl/Valheim-Documentation/blob/main/img/connecting-to-server/step5.png?raw=true)

Once you hit connect, Steam will automatically launch Valheim. You will be prompted to select your character before re-entering the game password before connecting.

Voila! You have successfully set up your G-Portal Valheim server for easy access.
